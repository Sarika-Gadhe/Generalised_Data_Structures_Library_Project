## 📖 About the Project


This project is a **professional C++17 Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) library**, developed with **object-oriented principles and template-based design** for reusability and scalability.  
It provides clean implementations of **Queue, Stack, Linked Lists, Trees, and Sorting/Searching algorithms**, along with a **menu-driven interactive console application** to demonstrate and visualize operations.  
Built with **industry-level coding practices** — clear structure, modular design, and generic programming — it serves as a valuable resource for **students, professionals, and interview preparation**.
